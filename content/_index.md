Hi, I'm Isaac! I'm currently a final-year undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Officially I study (applied) Mathematics, but these days I'm more interested in Computer Science and the Social Sciences.

I'm broadly concerned about technology and how it impacts society at large. Currently, I'm exploring AI trustworthiness, which includes issues such as safety, security, privacy and more.
