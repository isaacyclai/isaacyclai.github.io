## Online writing
- [The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf): Phillip Rogaway's 2015 essay on the political and moral implications of cryptography. If I had to choose a single piece from this list, I'd probably identify this as the one that's had the most influence on how I think about what I want to work on. I also encourage you to check out [other material](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/) that he's written in the years after. I don't agree with everything he has to say, but it's inspiring to see someone be able to take a long hard look at their field from a step back after having been immersed so deeply in it for so long.
- [You don’t need to work on hard problems](https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/): Career advice from Ben Kuhn I hope to embody.
- [200Bn Weights of Responsibility](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aEdTE-B6CSPPeUWYD-IgNVQVZM25f7MF-u9qn5KJJvo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.1dlv7gghyx56): Felix Hill (RIP) on the stress that comes with working in AI.
- [If you meet the Singaporean on the road](https://eigenmoomin.substack.com/p/if-you-meet-the-singaporean-on-the): "Give a Singaporean a few hundred thousand dollars, and he will build a tuition center."
- [I thought Singapore already has great government. Isn’t it good enough?](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7392532630866575360/): OGP director Li Hongyi's short reflection on failures in the handling of the [Megan Khung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Megan_Khung) case.
